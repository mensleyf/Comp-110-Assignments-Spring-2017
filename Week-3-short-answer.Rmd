# Chapter 5

5.1, 5.2

```{r,eval=FALSE}
barGraphHelper(CPS85)

```


I couldn't figure out how to do facet wrapping so I added that directly in R
```{r}
ggplot(data=CPS85,aes(x=sex,y=wage ,fill=married))+geom_bar(stat='identity',position='dodge', width=.9) + facet_wrap(~race)

```


```{r}
WorldMap(HappinessIndex,key=country,fill=corruption)
```

# Chapter 6

- d. glyph=rectangle, attributes=color and text

```{r}
Small<-
  NCHS %>%
  sample_n(size=5000)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
scatterGraphHelper(Small)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=Small,aes(x=bmi,y=weight))+geom_point()+aes(colour=smoker) 
```
Mapping:
color<-smoker
x axis<- bmi
y axis<- weight


# Chapter 7
7.1
- a.) summarise() and mean()

- b.) mutate()
- c.) arrange()
- d.) filter()
- e.) filter()
- f.) select()


7.4 Finding the errors
- a.)  no "" around First

- b.) can't use BabyNames inside group_by, move to line before

- c.) can't use BabyNames inside summarise, move to line before group_by

```{r}
Tmp<-
  BabyNames %>%
  group_by(year,sex) %>%
  summarise(totalBirths=sum(count))

```

```{r}
Total<-
  BabyNames %>%
summarise(num=sum(count))
```

7.5

a.) Output Table A

- filter(sex==F)

- arrange(count,sex)
   
b.) Output Table B

- arrange(sex)

c.) Output Table C

- arrange(-sex,count)

d.) Ouput Table D

- summarise(totalBirhts=sum(count))

e.) Output Table E

- select(name,count)

    
7.7

a.
```{r}
a<-
  BabyNames %>%
    group_by(year,sex) %>%
    summarise(total=sum(count))

```

b.
```{r}
b<-
  ZipGeography%>%
    group_by(State) %>%
    summarise(pop=sum(Population))

```

c.
```{r}
c<-
  Minneapolis2013 %>%
    group_by(First) %>%
    summarise(voteReceived=n())

```

d.
```{r}
d<-
  Minneapolis2013 %>%
    group_by(First) %>%
    summarise(voteReceived=n())

```
